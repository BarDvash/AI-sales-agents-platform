# Prepare for significant work session

## Steps

1. **PREPARATION:**
   - Read README.md to understand current project status
   - Note what's complete and what's next in the roadmap
   - Be ready to discuss options with the user

2. **DURING DISCUSSION:**
   - Discuss what to work on with the user
   - Ask clarifying questions as needed
   - Only suggest priorities if the user asks for suggestions

3. **DURING IMPLEMENTATION:**
   - Use TodoWrite to track progress
   - Follow project architectural principles
   - Maintain tenant isolation and data integrity

4. **BEFORE COMMITTING:**
   - Present summary of changes
   - **NEVER invoke `/commit-locally` or `/commit-and-push` without explicit user request**
   - Wait for user to explicitly ask to commit

You are now in 'prepare mode' - discuss with the user what to work on next.
